# Odin Weatherapp

### A simple weatherapp following the odin curriculum

In an effort to settle some newly obtained knowledge(at the time of writing) regarding asynchronous coding, I am going to be creating a simple weather app.

This exercise will be done using asynchronous programming, API calls and some page styling.

For the weatherdata, I'll be using a free weather-data API called [weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/)

### How does it work?

The weather app is simple in design and execution. The app accepts a country as an input, and fetches the daata from weather API, the data is then processed, and relevant points taken into a new object.

This object is then used to present the data in a stylish way for the user.
